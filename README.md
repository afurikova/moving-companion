# moving-companion
The Moving companion is an application that searches for a picture and information of given location 
(street and city/country). I created this application while taking a course Intro to Ajax on www.udacity.com. 
I wrote the code in JQuery and used Knockout js.

### In the project, I am using following APIs:  
*	The Google Street View Image API to upload a picture of the given address that is to be set as app background
*	NY Times API in order to request articles about given city
*	MediaWiki API that search for the relevant articles on Wikipedia
